/*
    Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(Q*Numcy::transpose(K)) * 1 / sqrt(d_k)) * V
    Where:
    - Q is query
    - K is key
    - d_k is the dimensions per attention head

    scaling factor = 1 / sqrt(d_k)

    Without scaling: 
    - The dot products of Q and K(transposed) can become large when d_k is large
    - This pushes softmax into regions with very small gradients (bad for learning)

    With scaling:
    - By multiplying the dot products(output of softmax function) by "scaling factor", we normalize them
    - This keeps the softmax output in a numerically stable range
    - Thus "scaling factor" ensures gradients don't vanish or explode

    Taking the floor:    
    The floor function returns the greatest integer that is less than or equal to the given value.
    As a result, if the input to floor is less than 1, it will return 0.

    Example:
    floor(0.9) -> 0
    floor(0.1) -> 0
    floor(1.7) -> 1
    
    This behavior can lead to unintended results, especially when dealing with small fractional values

            In the context of Transformers, self-attention is a mechanism where the model attends to different positions within the 
            same sequence to capture relationships and dependencies between words. Essentially, it's like asking questions about 
            different parts of the input sequence and using the answers to understand the overall meaning.

            Here's how the self-attention works with the same argument for query, key, and value:
            1. Each element in input sequence(@ei) acts as a query, key, and value:- 
               Every element (word) in the input sequence(@ei) is used as a query 
               to ask a question about the relationship with other words. Simultaneously, it also acts as a key for other elements to 
               compare against and as a value that holds information potentially relevant to the queries. 
            2. Attention scores:- 
               The Multi-Head Attention module calculates attention scores by comparing each query with all the keys.
               These scores indicate how relevant each value is to the specific query,
               considering both the content of the words and their positions.
            3. Weighted sum:-
               The attention scores are used to compute a weighted sum of the values.
               Words with higher attention scores contribute more to the final output, 
               effectively focusing on the most relevant parts of the sequence for each query.

            By using the same encoder input sequence(@ei) for query, key, and value, the self-attention mechanism allows the 
            model to learn relationships between any two words within the sequence, regardless of their order. 
            This is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies and the overall context of the input.         
         */

            - It's like asking a question to get a focus on specific parts of the input.            
            @ei_key,
            - Contains the keys used to compute attention scores for each query.
            - Each key corresponds to a value in the @ei_value tensor.

            - The return value...

                 * WORKAROUND IMPLEMENTATION FOR SCALAR DIVISION
                 * 
                 * Original Issue:
                 * - The template operator/(F x) that uses cc_tokenizer::allocator fails despite:
                 *   1. Confirmed allocator<double> specialization exists (static_assert passes)
                 *   2. scaleFactor is verified to be of type double (typeid shows 'd')
                 * - The root cause appears to be template instantiation/visibility issue in complex inheritance chain
                 *
                 * Current Solution:
                 * 1. Creates a temporary Collective<t> with shape [1,1] initialized to zeros
                 *    - Uses Numcy::zeros instead of allocator to avoid template issues
                 *    - Explicitly sets the single element to scaleFactor value
                 * 2. Uses existing Collective<t>/Collective<t> operator
                 *
                 * Advantages:
                 * - Avoids problematic allocator path entirely
                 * - Uses already tested/working matrix division
                 * - Maintains numerical consistency with other operations
                 *
                 * Trade-offs:
                 * - Slightly less efficient than direct scalar division:
                 *   - Allocates temporary matrix (though small)
                 *   - Uses full matrix division machinery
                 * - Requires scaleFactor to be convertible to type t
                 *
                 * Future Improvements:
                 * 1. Could implement optimized scalar division operator later:
                 *    template<typename t>
                 *    Collective<t> operator/(t scalar) { element-wise division }
                 * 2. Should investigate why allocator path fails despite proper specialization
                 *
                 * Debugging Notes:
                 * - Verified working for float/double cases
                 * - Maintains proper dimensionality in output
                 * - Preserves exception safety guarantees

                    If input sequences are of equal length and don't have padding, then src_mask might not be meeded. However, it's best to support it for flexibility later.

                    In a Transformer encoder, src_mask (source mask) is typically used in the self-attention mechanism to:
                    1. Prevent attending to padding tokens (mask out padded positions in the input).
                    2. Control which tokens can attend to which (if needed, like in some structured data cases).

                    What You Need to Do?
                    If you're using matmul(Q, K^T), apply the mask before softmax:

                    Make sure src_mask has negative infinity (-inf) where padding exists, so softmax turns those values into 0.

                    Check Attention Class:
                    If attention implementation already accepts a mask parameter, pass src_mask from the encoder when calling forward()
