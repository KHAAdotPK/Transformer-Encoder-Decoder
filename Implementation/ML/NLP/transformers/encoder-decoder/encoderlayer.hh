/*
    Transformer, has "encoder layers" (instead of one encoder we have few). Each "encoder layer" (or just an encoder) is very similar to other or all encoders have same architecture. 
    Each encoder or "encoder layer" consists of two layers: Self-attention and a feed Forward Neural Network. 

    As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector.
    After embedding the words in input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.   
    The embedding only happens in the bottom most encoder, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that is directly below.

    Each encoder layer in a transformer consists of:
    - Multi-head self-attention(attention.hh).
    - A feedforward network (FFN, EncoderFeedForwardNetwork.hh).
    - Layer normalization and dropout rate.

        Layer Normalization
        -------------------
        - Layer normalization is a technique to normalize the inputs across the features for each training example.
        - It helps stabilize and accelerate training by reducing internal covariate shift.
        - It is applied after the multi-head attention and feed-forward network in the encoder layer.
        - The normalization is done independently for each training example, making it suitable for variable-length sequences.

                The output of MULTIHEADATTENTION::forward() is typically a transformed representation of the input sequence, where each token's representation has been updated based on attention over all tokens in the sequence. In a Transformer encoder, this output is usually processed further in the following steps:

                What to Do with the Output of MULTIHEADATTENTION::forward()?
                1. Pass it to the Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
                   - The multi-head self-attention output is fed into a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN).
                   - In this implementation it corespondes to passing it to EncoderFeedForwardNetwork::forward():
                     EncoderFeedForwardNetwork::forward(output);

                2. Apply Layer Normalization
                   - After adding a residual connection (if applicable), the output is normalized.
                   - In this implementation it correspondes to EncoderLayerNormalization::forward():
                     EncoderLayerNormlization::forward(output);
                
                3. Add Residual Connection (Optional, but Important in Transformer)
                   - If this is a standard Transformer encoder implementation, then add a residual connection before applying layer normalization.
                   output = input + output;  // Residual connection
                   EncoderLayerNormalization::forward(output);
                
                4. Use it as Input for the Next Encoder Layer (If Using Stacked Encoders)
                   - If Transformer encoder implementation has multiple layers, the output of this layer becomes the input to the next encoder layer.
                
                5. Pass to the Decoder (If Implementing an Encoder-Decoder Model)
                   - If this is part of an encoder-decoder Transformer (e.g., for machine translation), the final encoder output will be used as input to the decoder.

                    This might seem redundant at first glance, but there's a specific reason for it.

                    While it may seem like a repetition, using the same argument for query, key, and value in the MultiHeadAttention call 
                    enables self-attention, a fundamental mechanism for Transformers to understand the relationships within a sequence.

                    Read more about in the comment section of MULTIHEADATTENTION::forward()
    
                    ====================== SELF-ATTENTION EXPLANATION ======================
                    Self-attention is a key component of Transformer models. In this context,
                    we pass the same input (ei) as the query, key, and value to the attention 
                    mechanism:

                    output = attention.forward(ei, ei, ei, mask);

                    This is not a mistakeâ€”this is how *self*-attention works by design.

                    Why pass the same input for all three?
                    -------------------------------------
                    - Query (Q): What we are searching for in the input.
                    - Key   (K): What we are matching against.
                    - Value (V): What we use to compute the final output.

                    In self-attention, we want each token (or word) in the input sequence to:
                    - Look at all other tokens (including itself),
                    - Compute how much attention it should give to each,
                    - And then create a new, weighted representation of itself.

                    By using the same input for Q, K, and V, we allow the model to:
                    - Capture dependencies and relationships between all tokens,
                    - Learn which other tokens are important for understanding each token's context,
                    - Dynamically adapt based on sequence position and content.

                    This enables the model to "pay attention" to relevant tokens no matter where 
                    they appear in the sequenceâ€”something especially useful in NLP tasks like 
                    translation, summarization, or sentiment analysis.

                    Summary:
                    --------
                    Self-attention = Attention(query=input, key=input, value=input)
                    This is what allows the model to understand each token in the *context* of all others.

                    For example:
                    Input sentence: "The cat sat on the mat"
                    The representation for "sat" will consider its attention to "cat", "on", and even "mat",
                    allowing the model to understand its role better in the sentence.
