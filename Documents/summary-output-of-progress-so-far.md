# Debug Output Analysis

![Screen shot of debug information of progress so far](https://github.com/KHAAdotPK/Transformer-Encoder-Decoder/blob/main/Documents/out-put-so-far.png)

The debug output provides a detailed snapshot of the internal state of this model during execution. Here's a breakdown of the key components and observations:

# Evaluation of Code and Output

## **1. Positional Encoding (`pe`)**:
- The positional encoding (`pe`) is computed using sine and cosine transformations of the scaled position indices (`p * dt`).
- The sine values are used for even indices, and cosine values are used for odd indices, which aligns with the standard Transformer positional encoding formula.
- The output shows that the positional encoding is correctly computed for the first row (real tokens), while the second and third rows (padding tokens) are zeroed out, as expected.

## **2. Scaling Term (`dt * SCALING_FACTOR`)**:
- The scaling term (`dt`) grows exponentially due to the use of `std::exp` and the large `SCALING_FACTOR_CONSTANT` (10000.0).
- This results in extremely large values (e.g., `-2.05823e+54`), which could lead to numerical instability or overflow issues.
- **Recommendation**: Normalize `dt` by dividing by the embedding dimension (`dm`) or reduce the `SCALING_FACTOR_CONSTANT` to prevent exponential growth.

## **3. Mask Application**:
- The mask is correctly applied to zero out padding positions in the positional encoding.
- The first row of `pe` contains valid positional encodings, while the second and third rows are zeroed out, indicating that padding tokens are correctly ignored.

## **4. Sine and Cosine Transformations**:
- The sine and cosine transformations (`sin_transformed_product` and `cos_transformed_product`) are computed correctly.
- The output shows that sine values are used for even indices and cosine values for odd indices, as expected.

## **5. Encoder Input (`ei`)**:
- The encoder input (`ei`) is formed by concatenating the positional encoding (`pe`) and the input sequence (`is`).
- The output shows that `ei` contains the correct values for the first row (real tokens), while the second and third rows (padding tokens) are zeroed out.

## **6. Debug Output**:
- The debug output is verbose and provides detailed information about the intermediate computations, which is helpful for debugging.
- However, the exponential growth in `dt * SCALING_FACTOR` is a concern and should be addressed to ensure numerical stability.

## **Key Observations**:
1. **Numerical Stability**:
   - The exponential growth in `dt * SCALING_FACTOR` is a significant issue. It can lead to numerical instability, overflow, or underflow during training.
   - **Fix**: Normalize `dt` by dividing by the embedding dimension (`dm`) or reduce the `SCALING_FACTOR_CONSTANT`.

2. **Positional Encoding**:
   - The positional encoding is computed correctly, with sine values for even indices and cosine values for odd indices.
   - The mask is applied correctly to zero out padding positions.

3. **Encoder Input**:
   - The encoder input (`ei`) is formed correctly by concatenating the positional encoding (`pe`) and the input sequence (`is`).

4. **Padding Handling**:
   - Padding tokens are correctly ignored, as evidenced by the zeroed-out rows in `pe` and `ei`.

## **Recommendations**:
1. **Normalize `dt`**:
   - Modify the computation of `dt` to prevent exponential growth:
     ```cpp
     dt[i * dt.getShape().getNumberOfColumns() + j] = std::exp(value) / (t)dm;
     ```

2. **Reduce `SCALING_FACTOR_CONSTANT`**:
   - Experiment with smaller values of `SCALING_FACTOR_CONSTANT` (e.g., 1000.0 or 100.0) to reduce the rate of exponential growth.

3. **Gradient Clipping**:
   - Use gradient clipping during training to prevent exploding gradients caused by large values in the positional encoding.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Continue using verbose debug output to monitor the values of `dt`, `pe`, and `ei` during training.
   - Check for NaNs or infinities in the model's outputs to ensure numerical stability.

----

## **Conclusion**:
The code is functionally correct and aligns with the standard Transformer architecture. However, the exponential growth in `dt * SCALING_FACTOR` is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure numerical stability. By normalizing `dt` or reducing the scaling factor, you can prevent numerical instability and improve the robustness of the model.
